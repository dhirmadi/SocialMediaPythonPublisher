# Legacy Redirects — Feature Plans

This folder exists to keep **older documentation references** working.

Historically, some docs referenced feature plans under:
- `docs_v2/08_Features/08_03_Feature_plan/<file>.yaml`

The **canonical** location is now inside each feature’s `stories/` folder:
- `docs_v2/08_Features/<NNN_feature_name>/stories/<SS_story_name>/<NNN_SS_plan.yaml>`

YAML files in this folder contain a `migrated_to` pointer to the canonical plan.
