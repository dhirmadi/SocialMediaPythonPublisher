# Legacy Redirects — Feature Requests

This folder exists to keep **older documentation references** working.

Historically, some docs referenced feature requests under:
- `docs_v2/08_Features/08_01_Feature_Request/<file>.md`

The **canonical** location is now inside each feature folder:
- `docs_v2/08_Features/<NNN_feature_name>/<NNN_feature.md>`

Files in this folder redirect to the canonical feature request documents.
