# Legacy Redirects — Feature Designs

This folder exists to keep **older documentation references** working.

Historically, some docs referenced feature designs under:
- `docs_v2/08_Features/08_02_Feature_Design/<file>.md`

The **canonical** location is now:
- `docs_v2/08_Features/<NNN_feature_name>/<NNN_design.md>`

If you landed here from a link, open the file you were looking for in this folder — it will redirect you to the canonical design document.
