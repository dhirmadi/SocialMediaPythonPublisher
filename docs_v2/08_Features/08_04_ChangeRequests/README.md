# Legacy Redirects — Change Requests

This folder exists to keep **older documentation references** working.

Historically, some docs referenced “change requests” under:
- `docs_v2/08_Features/08_04_ChangeRequests/<feature>/<id>_*`

In the current V2 layout, the canonical location for work items is inside:
- `docs_v2/08_Features/<NNN_feature_name>/stories/<SS_story_name>/...`

Files in this legacy folder redirect to the canonical story/design/plan locations.
