## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Sprint) ✅ DONE
1. ✅ Eliminate deprecation warnings (now 0)
2. ✅ Add shared fixtures (`conftest.py`) and reduce duplication
3. ✅ Add CLI entrypoint tests (CLI coverage now 97%)
4. ✅ Lift overall coverage to 92% (above 85% target)

### Short-Term (Next 2 Sprints) 🔜 Planned
5. Improve storage service coverage (target: 90%+)
6. Improve web service layer coverage (target: 90%+)
7. Add more integration tests with mocked external APIs

### Long-Term (Ongoing) 📋 Backlog
8. Maintain 90%+ coverage in PR reviews
9. Add performance/load tests where needed
